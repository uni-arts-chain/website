Uni-Arts provides support for the above functions through blockchain infrastructure and Dapp. The Uni-Arts team will make full use of the developed on-chain tools to operate the artwork creation and sharing platform. At the same time, any other third parties can also use the Uni-Arts's infrastructure to combine their own business and resource advantages to carry out similar businesses.",

For example: BABE/GRANDPA algorithm achieves the stability and efficiency of the NPoS consensus protocol to meet the requirements of the application chain. WebAssembly's chain upgrade technology ensures rapid product iteration and on-chain upgrade requirements.",

For example, the BABE/GRANDPA algorithm achieves the stability and efficiency of the NPoS consensus protocol to meet the requirements of the application chain. , WebAssembly-based chain upgrade technology ensures rapid product iteration and on-chain upgrade requirements. At the same time, Polkadot's decentralized community governance method is the future development direction of blockchain and the Internet, as well as the direction pursued by the Uni-Arts. Finally, the XCMP cross-chain protocol brings possibilities for the cross-chain ecology of the art assets of Uni-Arts.",

        "articles3-content": "UART is the Native Token of Uni-Arts Chain Network, with an initial supply of 10 million. Mainly used to maintain network ecological security, decentralization, and block rewards. UINK is the first application governance token of Uni-Arts Chain Network. The initial supply is zero and can only be generated by locking the UART. There is no upper limit on the total amount and there is a mechanism for destruction. Mainly used for community development and incentives for applications. Later, there will be more rich UINK gameplay as the application goes online."
